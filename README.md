# **Simple Voting App**

A simple voting app built using React and Docker that allows users to cast their votes for different options and display the results in real-time.

**Prerequisites for using it on your system**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system

**How to Run**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/\<repo-name\>.git
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal
3. Run npm install to install the required packages
4. Run npm start to start the development server
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of the project, I learned and revsed the following core concepts:

1. useState Hook
2. Conditional rendering
3. event handling
4. array manipulation

## Upcoming Features

Making the app full stack with the help of Node.js, Mysql and Express so that the database can be maintained.

Additionally, I would like to allow two differnt types of users to sign in to the app and assign differnet credentials to them
